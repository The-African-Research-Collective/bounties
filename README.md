## Eligibility

Our bounties are open to undergraduates across all disciplines in Nigerian Universities. Potential winners will be validated.

## Participation Guidelines

* You may fork the repository to which the bounty is attached. Please only open a PR once you have completed the task.
* At our discretion, we may allow you to take ownership of a task if we think you are near completion. In that case, the bounty is closed to everyone, and we work with you to merge your work.
* Unfortunately, we are unable to provide individual guidance on each bounty. We will make sure that the issue describing the bounty is updated with all the information you need and that we know.
* We are working to structure this process correctly, so please refer to this README periodically for updates.
